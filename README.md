# Juggling_Balls_Public
Smart Juggling Balls is a project of mine which consists of 3 basic modules: 
arduino pro mini (compatible) MPU 6050 and nrf24
and a bunch of LEDS of course :)
The files I publish include the PCB manufacturing Gerber files
STL files for the casing (ment for 3d printing)
and some code I wrote.
The idea is to have colorful and happy juggling balls which can change lightning based on the sensor readings 
and remote maniputations communicating via nrf24.
