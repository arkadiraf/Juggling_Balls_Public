# Juggling_Balls_Public
Smart Juggling Balls is a project of mine which consists of 3 basic modules: 
arduino pro mini (compatible) MPU 6050 and nrf24
and a banch of LEDS of course :)
the files i publish include the PCB manufacturing Gerber files
STL files for the casing (ment for 3d print)
and codes i write.
The idea is to have a colorful and happy juggling balls which can change lightning based on the sensor readings 
and remote maniputaltions using nrf24

Build enjoy and share.
